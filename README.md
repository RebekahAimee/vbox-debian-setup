# vbox-debian-setup
A script I'm messing around with, unfinished and untested at the moment. It's supposed to go through the motions of setting up a Debian environment in VirtualBox--updating headers, installing updates, the stuff you do from the command line.

Don't run this script as it is! I'm still working on it. This isn't even an alpha version yet, it's still being written.
